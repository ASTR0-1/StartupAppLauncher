<h1>üíæStratup App Launcher</h1>
‚ÑπÔ∏è In this application you can define which apps would startup when your notebook is in a charge state.<br>

You can append file paths in Paths.txt to modify which apps should be started up.<br>

<ins>It starts apps only when notebook is in charge state</ins>.<br>
I've developed it for my notebook to launch needed apps when I'm at home on charge.<br>
It perfectly fits if you don't want to run a lot of your application each time you start your laptop.<br>

<i>(I know you can use sleep mode :) but if you walk away from charge u need to close up all the apps to save battery life<br>
so it's better to turn it off and relaunch, and when u finally on charge u can use this app to startup needed apps)</i>

<h3><b>‚öôÔ∏èConfiguration:</b></h3>
<b>To setup launcher just unzip the launcher zip and change "Paths.txt" as you wish.</b><br>
<i>(Or you can manually clone git repo and rebuild it as you wish.)</i><br>
Zip file: (https://github.com/ASTR0-1/StartupAppLauncher/files/9349542/StartupAppLauncher.zip) <br><br>
